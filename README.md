# PHP - MXTK
PHP - Mathematical Xpression Tool-Kit

## Description
The PHP Mathematical Expression Tool Kit (MXTk) is a simple to use, easy to integrate and efficient run-time mathematical expression parser and evaluation engine. MXTK supports numerous forms of functional, logical and vector processing semantics and is very easily extendible.

## Capabilities
The MXTK has the following capabilities:
* Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
* Implicit Multiplication
* Equalities & Inequalities (=, ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
* Logical operators (and, or)
* Control structures (if-else if-else)
* Expression local variables and strings
* User defined variables, strings and constants
* Scientific notation support
* Single file implementation

## Example Expressions
* <pre>(3.35456E+03*x*x - 1.28000E+02 * x + 10) * 4.00000E-02 </pre> Here x is the variable and input to the expression 
* <pre>if (x == 0) (a); else if (x == 1) (b); else if (x == 2) (c); else (0); </pre>  Here x, a, b, c are variables and inputs to the expression
